basilisk
========

Implementation of my lang library, lisp-like interpreter written in go.

## Installation
Just run
```sh
go get github.com/cptaffe/basilist
go get github.com/cptaffe/lang
go install github.com/cptaffe/basilist
```
at your terminal and tada! A mostly useless lisp-like interpreter will be avaliable at the command `basilisk`, that is unless you haven't got your `$GOPATH` directory set in your `$PATH` variable. That is if you run Linux or OS X, screw you Windows!

## Notes

There is a langauge specified in the lang/token package which has a lot more features than lang/optim will actually do. What it does have is written at the [lang](http://github.com/cptaffe/lang) repo.
